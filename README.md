# Wind-Speed-Forecasting-using-Bi-LSTM
A deep learning project that utilizes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to forecast wind speed based on historical weather data. The model captures complex temporal dependencies and improves accuracy by learning from both past and future context in time series data.
